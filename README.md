# Predicting-House-Prices

### Target: Predict house prices using multiple Machine Learning Algorithms considering different sets of house and zip code features:

1. Main Dataset: Source www.redfin.com:
    * Obtained sold houses from Dec 2019-Dec 2020.
    * The sold houses located in North California distributed between 49 cities and 94 Zip Codes.
    * Data has 8,790 Observations and 27 Variables.
    * Data Wrangling is needed: Dataset has NANs, Wrong values, insignificant columns and Duplicates.

 ### ****** Adding more Datasets to enhance our prediction ******
