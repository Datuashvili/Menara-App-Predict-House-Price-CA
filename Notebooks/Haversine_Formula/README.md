## 1.  Introduction<a id='1_Introduction'></a>

**The Haversine formula** is perhaps the first equation to consider when understanding how to calculate distances on a sphere. The word "Haversine" comes from the function:

## 2. Objective

**The Haversine formula** will help us to find all schools within 3 miles of every house and then we can calculate the average GreatSchool Ratings for all schools within 3 miles of every house in our dataset.
